Sets the size of the underlying logging area of the Berkeley DB environment.[br]
By default, or if the value is set to 0, the minimum region size is used, approximately 128KB.[br]
The log region is used to store filenames, and so may need to be increased in size if a large number of files will be opened and registered with the specified Berkeley DB environment's log manager

<set_lg_regionmax>size of the underlying logging area</set_lg_regionmax>
<set_lg_max>Maximum size of a single file in the log</set_lg_max>
<set_lg_max_text>
Sets the maximum size of a single file in the log.[br]
The value set for this parameter may not be larger than the maximum unsigned four-byte value.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of a log file is 10MB.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of a log file is 256KB.[br]
In addition, the configured log buffer size must be larger than the log file size.[br]
(The logging subsystem divides memory configured for in-memory log records into "files", 
as database environments configured for in-memory log records may exchange log records with 
other members of a replication group, and those members may be configured to store log records on-disk.)[br]
When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory log buffer size is large enough that no transaction 
will ever span the entire buffer, and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer
 is full and no space can be freed because a transaction that started in the first log "file" 
 is still active. 
</set_lg_max_text>
<set_lg_bsize>size of the in-memory log buffer</set_lg_bsize>
<set_lg_bsize_text>Sets the size of the in-memory log buffer.[br]
For the DB, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of 
the in-memory log buffer is approximately 32KB.[br]
For the BDB SQL interface, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging,
 the default size of the in-memory log buffer is approximately 64KB.[br]
 Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or a transaction commit forces the 
 information to be flushed to stable storage.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data,
larger buffer sizes can increase throughput.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of the in-memory log 
buffer is 1MB.[br]
Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or transaction abort or commit frees up
 the memory for new transactions.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data, 
 the buffer size must be sufficient to hold all log information that can accumulate during the longest 
 running transaction.[br]
 When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory 
 and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a 
 transaction that started in the first log "file" is still active.</set_lg_bsize_text>
 <set_cachesize>size of the shared memory buffer pool</set_cachesize>
 <set_cachesize_text>
 Sets the size of the shared memory buffer pool — that is, the cache.[br]
 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.
The syntax of this parameter is a single line with the string one or more whitespace characters, 
and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

This is the crucial performance parameter.[br] Too small and the

<iscsi_explain>iSCSI is an abbreviation of Internet Small Computer System Interface, 
an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.[br]
By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage
 over long distances.[br]
 iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs),

In Block I/O it defines a mapping between  a  "Logical  Unit Number" and a given block device.[br]
This mode will perform direct block i/o with the device,  bypassing  page-cache for  all operations.[br]
This allows for efficient handling of non-aligned sector transfers (virtualized  environments)  and  large block  transfers  (media servers).[br]
This mode works ideally with high-end storage HBAs and for applications that  either  do  not need  caching  between  application  and  disk or need the large block throughput.

They require a few patches to the kernel and make use of new kernel features for process scheduling, isolation and network isolation between containers.[br]

<samba_strict_allocate>Windows behaviour storage blocks</samba_strict_allocate>
<samba_strict_allocate_text>controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server.[br]
When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems

 Since the timer is reset for every subsequent request, it is not necessary to have a long blocking period;
 in the event of a DoS attack, this timer will keep getting reset.[br]

<DDOS_WHITE_EXPLAIN>
IP addresses of trusted clients can be whitelisted to insure they are never
denied.[br]The purpose of whitelisting is to protect software, scripts, local
searchbots, or other automated tools from being denied for requesting large
amounts of data from the server.[br]Whitelisting should *not* be used to add
customer lists or anything of the sort, as this will open the server to abuse.[br]
This module is very difficult to trigger without performing some type of
malicious attack, and for that reason it is more appropriate to allow the
module to decide on its own whether or not an individual customer should be
blocked.</DDOS_WHITE_EXPLAIN>

<freeweb_reverse_proxy_explain>
Apache can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy mode.[br]
An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.[br]
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target 
and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.[br]
The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.[br]
A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall

<samba_virtual_explain>Virtual servers are a technique for creating the illusion of multiple NetBIOS servers on the network,
when in reality there is only one.[br]
The technique is simple to implement: a machine simply registers more than one NetBIOS name in association with its IP address.[br]
There are tangible benefits to doing this.[br]
The accounting department, for example, might have an accounting server, and clients of it would see just the accounting disks and printers. The marketing department could have their own server, marketing, with their own reports, and so on. However,
 all the services would be provided by one medium-sized Unix workstation (and one relaxed administrator),
  instead of having one small server and one administrator per department.

<samba_wins_explain>broadcasting - whether it be browsing or name registration and resolution - does not pass easily across 
multiple subnets.[br]
In addition, many broadcasts tend to bog down networks.[br]
To solve this problem, Microsoft now provides the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS),
 a cross-subnet NBNS, which Samba supports.[br]
 With it, an administrator can designate a single machine to act as a WINS server,
 and can then provide each client that requires name resolution the address of the WINS server.[br]
 Consequently, name registration and resolution requests can be directed to a single machine from any point on the network, 
 instead of broadcast.

You can add ip addresses like 192.168.12.23 or 192.168.1.255 where 192.168.12.23 is either the LMB IP address or the broadcast 
address of the remote network That is, the LMB is at 192.168.12.23, or the address could be given as 192.168.1.255 where the netmask is assumed to be 24 bits
(255.255.255.0).[br]When the remote announcement is made to the broadcast address of the remote network, every host will receive our announcements. This is noisy and therefore undesirable but may be necessary if we do not know the IP address of the remote LMB.
DOMAIN is optional (the workgroup) and can be either our own workgroup or that of the remote network.[br]
If you use the workgroup name of the remote network, our NetBIOS machine names will end up looking like they belong to that workgroup.[br]
